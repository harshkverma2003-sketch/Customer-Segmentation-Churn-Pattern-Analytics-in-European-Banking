# Customer-Segmentation-Churn-Pattern-Analytics-in-European-Banking
This project analyzes customer churn across geography, age, credit score, tenure, and financial profile using Power BI. The dashboard identifies high-risk customer segments and high-value churn patterns to support targeted retention strategies.
Customer churn is a major problem in the banking industry. When customers leave the bank, it causes loss of revenue and increases the cost of acquiring new customers. Although banks track overall churn rate, they often do not know which specific customer groups are more likely to leave.
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn by dividing customers into different segments based on geography, age, financial profile, and tenure.

**2. Problem Statement**

Banks have customer data but face difficulty in:


Identifying high-risk customer segments


Understanding churn differences across countries


Measuring whether churn is happening among high-value or low-value customers


Because of this, retention strategies are often general and not targeted.

3. Project Objective
The main objective of this project is:
To calculate overall churn rate


To identify which customer segments have higher churn


To compare churn behavior across European regions





5. Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about bank customers including:
CustomerId – Unique customer identifier


CreditScore – Customer credit rating


Geography – Country (France, Spain, Germany)


Gender – Male or Female


Age – Customer age


Tenure – Years with bank


Balance – Account balance


NumOfProducts – Number of products used


HasCrCard – Credit card ownership


IsActiveMember – Customer activity status


EstimatedSalary – Estimated salary


Exited – Indicates whether customer churned



**Churn Analysis**


Calculated overall churn rate


Compared churn across segments


Analyzed churn distribution across geography and demographics



**High-Value Customer Analysis**


Identified customers with high balances


Checked churn among premium customers


Evaluated potential revenue risk



**7. Dashboard Description**


The Power BI dashboard contains three main pages:


Page 1: Overall Churn Overview

Total Customers


Overall Churn Rate


Churn by Geography


Churn by Gender


This page shows the overall churn situation.

Page 2: Segmentation & Demographics

Churn by Age Group


Churn by Credit Score


Churn by Tenure


Churn by Balance


This page identifies high-risk segments.

Page 3: High-Value & Risk Analysis

High-balance churn rate


Salary vs Balance analysis


At-risk customer list


This page highlights revenue risk.






10. Conclusion
This project provides a clear understanding of churn patterns using customer segmentation. By identifying high-risk groups and financial risk areas, banks can design better retention strategies and reduce revenue loss.
